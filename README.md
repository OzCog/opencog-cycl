Opencog-Cycl

This project is an attempt to map Cyc KBs to atomspace (e.g. the OpenCyc Knowledgebase) which are written in the Cycl knowledge representation language.
It originates from a discussion between Linas and Prokhor. 
One main purpose willbe to provide new inference mechanisms for improved reasoning on the KB.
