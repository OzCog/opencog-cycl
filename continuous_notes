Notes & thoughts on the project

Started 02 09 2023 by Prokhor Zhakharov

The notes in this file are not made systematically or structured in the current stage.
A systematically structured condensate of those (sometimes maybe phoney) ideas will later be realised in the README file.

-	Atoms are nodes. Relations are links. Rules are trees.

- 	The migration should take place incrementally, beginning with the rules for building a classical ontology 
	(basically the skeleton of th class-membership rules:
		(#$isa #$Horse #$Mammal) --> (Inheritance (Concept "Horse") (Concept "Mammal"))

-	The concept of microtheories will be expanded to context, which is a list of strings that can be modified.
	Besides from microtheories in the original KB, such entries can also be added automatically by reasoning
	agents, queries and manually by the Ontology Engineer. Thus e.g. it can be exressed, that a fact only holds
	in a specific belief etc.
